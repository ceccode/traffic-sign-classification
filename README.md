# Traffic sign classifier

Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier capstone project for Machine Learning Zoomcamp course: [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/12-capstone](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/12-capstone).

## Introduction

The main goal is build a model to classify traffic signs with Convolutional Neural Network.

## Dataset

The dataset we’ll be using to train our own custom traffic sign classifier is the German Traffic Sign Benchmark https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.

### Abount the dataset

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

* Single-image, multi-class classification problem
* More than 40 classes
* More than 50,000 images in total
* Large, lifelike database
